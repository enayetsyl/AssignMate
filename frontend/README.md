Domino-Style Grammar Cards
Concept:
Design printable cards that contain fragments of a sentence on one card (e.g., “The cat jumped”) and various prepositional phrases on other cards (e.g., “onto the couch”, “in the garden”). Students can play a domino-style matching game by matching the sentence fragment to a suitable prepositional phrase.

Print Layout:

Cards printed on cardstock that students can cut out.

Print instructions that prompt matching by reading aloud or by gluing matched pairs onto a worksheet.

Variations:

Add dummy cards for higher difficulty.

Use preposition-specific cards for drills.



Grammar Sorting and Diagramming
Concept:
Create a worksheet in which students identify and circle or underline the prepositional phrases in a full sentence, and then classify them by function (time, place, manner, etc.).

Worksheet Example:

Sentence: "The children played in the park on a sunny afternoon."

Activity Instructions:

Underline the prepositional phrases.

Write “place” next to "in the park" and “time” next to "on a sunny afternoon."

Printable Worksheet Ideas:

Include several sentences and a table or space for students to write down the type of each prepositional phrase.

Use diagramming boxes where students draw lines to connect phrases to pre-labeled categories.
